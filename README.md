# Color Tracking

This is a solo project I created for my Sensor Based Interaction class. It is created in Open Frameworks, and requires a webcam to work.
When the user right or middle clicks on somthing, it's color is selected and tracked. This will leave blobs of 'paint' behind. When only one object is one screen, the paint blobs appear as squares. When the objects collide, the screen is erased.

To run in Open frameworks, place everything in a folder under apps>myapps. The ofxCv, ofxImGui and ofxOpenCv addons were used.

To see the code in action, I have provided a demonstration [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L160ZiQKxbA).
